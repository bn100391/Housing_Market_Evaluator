# Is It Better To Buy A Home? Or Rent It?

This is a really interesting question because there is no static answer, only: *it depends*. 

And it depends on a lot of things. When I started really thinking about it I began to realize that there were so many variables that trying to do it all in your head for every option that you have isn't really feasable. So I decided to write a tool to *automate the process* of evaluating a given rental option against a given opportunity to buy a home/condo. 

If you'd like to take a look, just run this like you would run any other Python program.
