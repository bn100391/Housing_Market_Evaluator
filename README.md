# Is It Better To Buy A Home? Or Rent It?

This is a really interesting question because there is no static answer, only: *it depends*. 

And it depends on a lot of things. When I started really thinking about it I began to realize that there were were to many variables to work out for every investment option. So I decided to write a tool to *automate the process* of evaluating a given rental option against a given opportunity to buy a home/condo. The main idea here is to find the better investment vehicle. Would it be better to put the extra money on hand, saved by renting instead of buying, in the stock market?. Or would it see better returns placing into the ownership of a home?  

If you'd like to take a look, just run this like you would run any other Python program and follow the prompts.
